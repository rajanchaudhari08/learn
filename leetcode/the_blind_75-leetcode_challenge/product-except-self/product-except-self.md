# [Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/)

**Problem Statement**

_Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i]._

_The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer._

> You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

_Follow up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis._
